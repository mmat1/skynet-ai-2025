## Overview

### About the project

The purpose of this GitHub repository is to explore and identify opportunities for the use of Generative AI within Certifiable Inc.'s existing certification system. The goal is to redesign the architecture to support AI-driven enhancements that can manage the increased demand for software architecture certifications.

### Team Members

- Brandon Moriarty
- Chris Acton
- Jagreet Atwal
- Megin Mathew
- Ryan Hertzog

### Deliverables

The following deliverables will be provided:

- **Overview**: A narrative describing how AI is used in the certification system.
- **Diagrams**: Comprehensive views for each use of AI.
- **ADRs**: Architectural Decision Records for AI implementations, including trade-off analysis.
- **Implementation Details**: Pertinent implementation details (optional).
- **Video**: A five-minute video describing the team's approach (for semi-final teams).

### Judges' Criteria

The solutions will be evaluated based on:

- Innovative use of Generative AI.
- Suitability of the solution given the constraints.
- Appropriate levels of detail.
- Use of AI architecture patterns.
- Avoidance of AI architecture anti-patterns.
- Validation and verification of AI results.

## About Certifiable, Inc

Certifiable Inc. is a leading company in software architecture certification, based in the United States. The company provides accredited certification to qualified software architects through its flagship system, SoftArchCert. With the recent acceptance of software architecture certification in Europe, the U.K., and Asia, Certifiable Inc. is anticipating a significant increase in certification requests. This repository aims to explore opportunities to introduce AI to their current certification process to handle the expected growth efficiently.

### Certification Process

Certifiable Inc.'s certification process involves two main tests:

1. **Aptitude Test**: This test includes multiple-choice and short-answer questions. Multiple-choice questions are auto-graded, while short-answer questions are graded manually by expert software architects.
2. **Architecture Submission**: Candidates must create an architecture for a randomly assigned case study. The submissions are reviewed and graded by expert software architects.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

### Non-Functional Requirements

### Assumptions and Constraints

Certifiable Inc. faces several challenges due to the anticipated increase in certification requests:

- Manual grading of short-answer questions and architecture submissions is time-consuming.
- The current system may not be able to handle the increased volume of certification requests.
- Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the certification process is critical.

### AI Opportunities

The architecture team will explore the following AI opportunities:

- **Automated Grading**: Implementing AI to grade short-answer questions and architecture submissions.
- **AI-Driven Feedback**: Using AI to provide detailed feedback to candidates.
- **Scalability**: Redesigning the system architecture to support AI-driven enhancements and handle increased demand.
