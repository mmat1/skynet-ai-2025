## Context

As a recognized leader in certification, maintaining the accuracy of tests, case studies, and grading is crucial. Inaccurate grading can prevent candidates from obtaining or retaining employment, significantly impacting their careers. Furthermore, inaccurate or misleading certification exams and case studies can damage the company's credibility in the marketplace. Therefore, ensuring the accuracy of the certification process is essential for the company's success.

## Decision

Use rubrics for AI grading of short answer and case study architectures.

By incorporating a grading rubric into our AI solution, we can ensure that the certification process remains accurate, consistent, fair, efficient, and supportive of candidate growth, thereby protecting and enhancing our company's standing in the marketplace.

## Consequences

### Accuracy

A rubric provides clear, objective criteria for grading, which helps the AI to evaluate responses accurately. This reduces the risk of errors that could impact a candidate's career and the company's credibility.

### Consistency 

With a rubric, the AI can apply the same standards to every test and case study, ensuring consistent grading across all candidates. This consistency is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the certification process.

### Fairness

By using a standardized rubric, the AI can grade all candidates impartially, eliminating potential biases that might occur with human graders. This fairness is essential for upholding the company's reputation as a leader in certification.

### Efficiency

Rubrics streamline the grading process, allowing the AI to quickly and efficiently evaluate large volumes of tests and case studies. This efficiency helps the company manage its certification processes more effectively.

### Feedback

A rubric enables the AI to provide detailed feedback based on specific criteria, helping candidates understand their strengths and areas for improvement. This constructive feedback supports candidates' professional development and enhances the overall value of the certification.

### Transparency

With a rubric, students and educators can understand how grades are determined. This transparency helps in identifying areas of improvement and ensures fairness.
