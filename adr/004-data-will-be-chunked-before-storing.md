## Context

- Our AI grading system is designed to manage and evaluate large documents and datasets, providing efficient retrieval and processing capabilities.
- To handle the size and complexity of these documents, we need a strategy that ensures efficient storage, retrieval, and processing while maintaining data integrity and context.
- Chunking is the process of dividing large pieces of data into smaller, manageable segments, known as chunks. This technique is commonly used in data processing, storage, and retrieval to enhance efficiency and performance. Each chunk represents a portion of the original data, and these chunks can be processed, stored, and retrieved independently.

## Decision

- Chunking data before storage aligns with our goals of manageability, performance, scalability, context preservation, and enhanced capabilities. While it introduces some challenges, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, making it the preferred approach for our system.

## Consequences

### Pros

- Manageability:
  - Simplified Processing: Smaller chunks are easier to process and manage, reducing the complexity of handling large documents.
  - Efficient Storage: Chunking allows for more efficient storage management, as smaller pieces can be indexed and retrieved more effectively.
- Performance:
  - Faster Retrieval: Retrieving smaller chunks of data is faster and more efficient, improving overall system performance.
  - Parallel Processing: Enables parallel processing of chunks, speeding up data processing tasks.
- Scalability:
  - Handles Large Volumes: Scales better with increasing data volumes, as chunks can be processed and stored independently.
  - Flexible Scaling: Allows for flexible scaling strategies, such as distributing chunks across multiple storage nodes.
- Context Preservation:
  - Maintains Coherence: Chunking with overlapping content helps preserve context and coherence within each piece of data.
  - Improved Accuracy: Ensures that the semantic meaning of the data is maintained, improving the accuracy of retrieval and processing tasks.
- Enhanced Capabilities:
  - Granular Analysis: Facilitates more granular analysis and retrieval of data, enabling detailed insights and targeted processing.
  - Efficient Updates: Allows for efficient updates and modifications to specific chunks without affecting the entire dataset.

### Cons

- Data Integrity:
  - Consistency Challenges: Ensuring data integrity and consistency across multiple chunks can be complex.
  - Robust Mechanisms Needed: Requires robust mechanisms to maintain data integrity and coherence.
- Storage Overhead:
  - Increased Records: Chunking increases the number of records, potentially leading to higher storage overhead.
  - Optimization Required: Needs optimized storage strategies to manage the increased number of records effectively.
- Complexity:
  - Data Management: Introduces additional complexity in data management and retrieval.
  - Efficient Access Patterns: Requires the development of efficient data access patterns and indexing strategies.
- Implementation Effort:
  - Development Time: May require additional development time to implement and optimize chunking strategies.
  - Resource Allocation: Needs careful resource allocation to handle the increased complexity and storage requirements.
