## Context

- Our AI grading system requires the creation and modification of exam questions and case studies to ensure they remain relevant, accurate, and aligned with educational standards.
- The Admin UI is used for managing these tasks, and it is essential to gather feedback from Certifiable Inc experts to validate question validity, possible answer accuracy, and overall quality.
- To streamline this process, we aim to use AI to summarize the feedback from multiple experts before approving the questions.

## Decision

- We have decided to gather feedback from Certifiable Inc experts for new exam questions and case studies being added.
- The creation and modification of exams and case studies will be done through the Admin UI, and AI will be used to summarize the feedback from experts before final approval.

## Consequences

### Pros

- Expert Validation:
  - High-Quality Standards: Gathering feedback from multiple experts ensures that new questions and case studies meet high-quality standards and best practices.
  - Comprehensive Review: Provides a thorough review of question validity, possible answer accuracy, and overall quality.
- Enhanced Accuracy:
  - Diverse Perspectives: Incorporating feedback from various experts ensures a well-rounded evaluation, reducing the risk of errors and biases.
  - Improved Validity: Validates the accuracy and relevance of new questions and case studies, ensuring they are aligned with educational standards.
- Efficiency:
  - AI Summarization: Using AI to summarize expert feedback streamlines the review process, making it more efficient and reducing the time required for final approval.
  - Automated Insights: AI-generated summaries provide clear and actionable insights, facilitating quicker decision-making.
- Consistency:
  - Standardized Process: Establishes a standardized process for gathering and reviewing expert feedback, ensuring consistency across all new questions and case studies.
  - Uniform Criteria: Ensures that all feedback is evaluated based on the same criteria, maintaining fairness and reliability.
- Continuous Improvement:
  - Feedback Loop: Creates a continuous feedback loop, allowing for ongoing refinement and improvement of exam questions and case studies.
  - Adaptive Learning: The system can adapt and learn from expert feedback, continuously enhancing its performance and effectiveness.

### Cons

- Resource Requirements:
  - Time and Effort: Gathering and reviewing feedback from multiple experts requires additional time and effort from both the experts and administrators.
  - Human Resources: Requires the availability of qualified experts to provide feedback on new questions and case studies.
- Complexity:
  - Integration Effort: Integrating the feedback process into the Admin UI and using AI for summarization adds complexity to the system.
  - Coordination Overhead: Managing the coordination between experts, AI summarization, and final approval can add to the system's operational complexity.
- Cost Implications:
  - Additional Costs: Involving multiple experts and implementing AI summarization may incur additional costs related to human resources and technology.
  - Infrastructure: May require additional infrastructure to support the feedback gathering, summarization, and approval process.
