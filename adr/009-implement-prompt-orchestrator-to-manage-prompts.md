## Context

- Our AI grading system relies on a Large Language Model (LLM) to process and evaluate candidate responses.
- To ensure efficient and accurate processing, we need a mechanism to manage and coordinate the flow of prompts to the LLM.
- A Prompt Orchestrator can help streamline this process by handling prompt validation, routing, and prioritization, ensuring that the LLM receives well-formed and contextually appropriate inputs in an organized manner.

## Decision

- We have decided to implement a Prompt Orchestrator to manage and coordinate the flow of prompts to our selected LLM. The Prompt Orchestrator will handle prompt validation, routing, and prioritization, ensuring efficient and accurate processing.

## Consequences

### Pros

- Improved Efficiency:
  - Streamlined Workflow: The Prompt Orchestrator streamlines the workflow by managing the flow of prompts, reducing bottlenecks and ensuring smooth processing.
  - Automated Coordination: Automates the coordination of prompts, reducing the need for manual intervention and improving overall efficiency.
- Enhanced Accuracy:
  - Validation: Ensures that all prompts are validated before being sent to the LLM, preventing errors and maintaining data integrity.
  - Contextual Relevance: Routes prompts based on context and relevance, ensuring that the LLM receives appropriate inputs for accurate evaluation.
- Prioritization:
  - Priority Handling: Allows for the prioritization of prompts based on predefined criteria, ensuring that critical or time-sensitive prompts are processed first.
  - Resource Optimization: Optimizes the use of computational resources by managing the order and flow of prompts.
- Scalability:
  - Scalable Architecture: The Prompt Orchestrator is designed to scale with the system, handling increasing volumes of prompts as the system grows.
  - Load Balancing: Distributes the load evenly across the system, preventing overload and ensuring consistent performance.
- Flexibility:
  - Customizable Rules: Allows for the implementation of customizable rules and criteria for prompt validation, routing, and prioritization.
  - Adaptability: Adapts to changing requirements and evolving datasets, ensuring that the system remains effective and relevant.

### Cons

- Implementation Effort:
  - Development Time: Implementing the Prompt Orchestrator requires significant development time and effort.
  - Complexity: Adds complexity to the system architecture, requiring careful design and integration.
- Resource Requirements:
  - Computational Load: Managing and coordinating prompts may require additional computational resources, potentially impacting system performance.
  - Maintenance: Requires ongoing maintenance to ensure the Prompt Orchestrator remains effective and up-to-date.
- Cost Implications:
  - Additional Costs: Developing and maintaining the Prompt Orchestrator may incur additional costs related to development, infrastructure, and maintenance.
  - Infrastructure: May require additional infrastructure to support the orchestration and management of prompts.
